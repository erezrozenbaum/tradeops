## 2. Gaps vs Spec

### 2.1 Investor Profile Schema — Missing Fields

The current `investor_profiles` table is missing fields required by spec §8:

| Spec Field | Status | Priority |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| `investment_goal` (enum) | ❌ Missing | High — decision engine input |
| `risk_tolerance` (enum: very_low…very_high) | ❌ Missing | High — decision engine input |
| `time_horizon` (short/medium/long_term) | ❌ Missing | High — decision engine input |
| `preferred_assets` (JSONB list) | ❌ Missing | Medium |
| `trading_frequency` (none/low/medium/high) | ❌ Missing | Medium |
| `capital_amount` | ❌ Missing | Medium — exists in financial_profile as derived value |
| `monthly_contribution` | ❌ Missing | Low |
| `guardian_required` | ❌ Missing | Medium — currently only `is_minor` flag |
| `investment_knowledge_score` | ❌ Missing | Low |
| `max_drawdown_comfort` | ❌ Missing | Low |

### 2.2 Risk Model Output — Missing Enforcement Fields

The current risk model outputs capital allocation percentages. The spec (§10) also requires:

| Spec Field | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| `allowed_strategy_families` | ❌ Missing |
| `blocked_strategy_families` | ❌ Missing |
| `live_trading_allowed` | ❌ Missing |
| `requires_paper_trading` | ❌ Missing |
| `minimum_paper_days` / `minimum_paper_trades` | ❌ Missing |
| `max_trade_size_percent` | ❌ Missing |
| `max_open_positions` | ❌ Missing |

### 2.3 Age-Based Safety Rules (Spec §9)

Only `is_minor` (bool) exists. No:
- Age tier classification (under 18, 18–25, 26–45, 46–60, 60+)
- `guardian_required` field
- Age-based strategy restriction logic in the risk model engine

### 2.4 Strategy Template Schema — Missing Fields

Current templates have: name, strategy_type, risk_level, description, parameters.  
Spec §13 also requires: `family`, `parameter_schema`, `min_experience_level`, `supported_assets`, `live_trading_supported`.

### 2.5 Backtest Validation Pass/Fail

The backtesting engine computes 6 metrics but does not enforce pass/fail rules against the investor's risk model (spec §18). No `backtest_passed`/`backtest_failed` lifecycle status.

### 2.6 Investor Profile Wizard

Current login form captures: full_name, date_of_birth, country, base_currency, local_currency, experience_level, is_minor. The multi-step wizard (spec §25) with goals, risk comfort, asset preferences is not implemented.

### 2.7 Financial Decision Engine

Entirely absent. The `/api/v1/investors/{id}/decision` endpoint does not exist.

---

## 3. Immediate Infrastructure Fix Required

**Blocker:** Routes registered as `@router.get("/")` are 404 with `redirect_slashes=False`.  
All collection endpoint decorators must use `""` instead of `"/"`.

This must be done before any other feature work.

---

## 4. Phase Tasks — Decision Engine Hardening

Tasks are ordered by dependency. Each task is independently deployable.

---

### TASK 0 — Fix routing (BLOCKER) ✅ DONE

**Type:** Bug fix  
**Risk:** 🟢 Safe  

Changed all `@router.get("/")`, `@router.post("/")` etc. to `@router.get("")`, `@router.post("")` across all router files. `redirect_slashes=False` is set on the app — fix is complete.

Files changed:
- `investor_profiles/router.py` ✅
- `goals/router.py` ✅
- `risk_modeling/router.py` ✅
- `strategy_library/router.py` ✅
- `strategy_selection/router.py` ✅
- `backtesting/router.py` ✅
- `paper_trading/router.py` ✅
- `ai_analysis/router.py` ✅
- `family_profiles/router.py` ✅

Not changed (no collection routes):
- `financial_profiles/router.py` — all routes use `/{investor_id}/...` path params
- `audit/router.py` — uses `/{investor_id}/audit-events`
- `dashboard/router.py` — uses `/{investor_id}/dashboard`

---

### TASK 1 — Add missing investor profile fields ✅ DONE

**Type:** DB schema change  
**Risk:** 🔴 Risky — requires Alembic migration  

Added to `investor_profiles` table via migration `0005_investor_profile_extended.py`:
- `investment_goal`, `risk_tolerance`, `time_horizon`, `preferred_assets` (JSONB), `trading_frequency`, `guardian_required`
- All nullable / defaulted — no existing rows broken
- Updated `models/investor_profile.py` with enums `RiskTolerance`, `TimeHorizon`, `TradingFrequency`
- Updated `schemas/investor_profile.py` — exposed in Create, Update, and Out schemas

---

### TASK 2 — Add age-based safety rules to risk model engine ✅ DONE

**Type:** Logic change  
**Risk:** 🟡 Moderate  

Implemented in `risk_modeling/service.py`:
- `_get_age_tier(dob)` → returns `(age, tier)` where tier is `minor / young_adult / adult / pre_retirement / retirement`
- Minor (<18): education-only allocation (100% low-risk, 0% everything else)
- Retirement (60+): shift 10% from growth/high-risk to low-risk; reduce max drawdown by 5%
- Pre-retirement (46–60): shift 5% from high-risk to low-risk
- Age tier stored on `RiskModel` (added via migration 0006)

---

### TASK 3 — Enrich risk model with enforcement fields ✅ DONE

**Type:** Schema change + logic  
**Risk:** 🟡 Moderate  

Added to `risk_models` table via migration `0006_risk_model_enforcement_fields.py`:
- `allowed_strategy_families`, `blocked_strategy_families` (JSONB lists)
- `live_trading_allowed` (bool, default False)
- `requires_paper_trading` (bool, default True)
- `max_trade_size_pct` (float), `max_open_positions` (int), `age_tier` (str)
- `_compute_enforcement()` in service.py populates all fields deterministically
- Enforcement logic: minors blocked from everything; stability/age/experience gate live trading and aggressive strategies
- Exposed in `schemas/risk_model.py` → `RiskModelOut`

---

### TASK 4 — Build `financial_decision` module (core of this phase) ✅ DONE

**Type:** New module  
**Risk:** 🟡 Moderate  

Create `backend/app/financial_decision/`:

```
financial_decision/
├── __init__.py
├── engine.py      # deterministic decision logic
├── service.py     # data aggregation
└── router.py      # GET /investors/{id}/decision
```

**engine.py** — pure function, no DB access:

```python
def evaluate(
    investor: InvestorProfile,
    financial_profile: FinancialProfile | None,
    stability: FinancialStabilityScore | None,
    risk_model: RiskModel | None,
    goals: list[FinancialGoal],
    family_context: FamilyProfile | None,
) -> InvestmentDecision
```

Decision output:

```json
{
  "can_invest": true,
  "readiness_classification": "ready_with_limits | not_ready | education_only | ready",
  "recommended_investment_pct": 35,
  "max_high_risk_pct": 5,
  "blocked_actions": ["live_trading", "high_risk_strategy"],
  "required_actions": ["maintain_emergency_fund"],
  "warnings": ["High debt ratio detected"],
  "explanation": "..."
}
```

Decision rules (deterministic):
- `can_invest = False` if: no financial profile, stability < 30, emergency_fund_months < 1
- `can_invest = True` but `readiness_classification = "ready_with_limits"` if: stability 30–60, debt-to-income > 40%, emergency_fund_months < 3
- `education_only` if: is_minor or investment_goal == "education"
- `blocked_actions` populated from risk model blocked_strategy_families + live_trading_allowed
- `required_actions` populated from scoring recommendations

**service.py** — assembles all data and calls engine.

**router.py** — stateless GET, returns computed decision (not persisted):

```
GET /api/v1/investors/{id}/decision
```

Register in `api/v1/router.py` as:

```python
api_router.include_router(decision_router, prefix="/investors/{investor_id}/decision", tags=["decision"])
```

Add audit event: `decision_evaluated`.

**Implemented:** `backend/app/financial_decision/` — `engine.py` (pure logic), `service.py` (data assembly), `router.py` (GET endpoint), `schemas.py` (output model). Registered in `api/v1/router.py`.

---

### TASK 5 — Investment Readiness card on dashboard ✅ DONE

**Type:** Frontend  
**Risk:** 🟢 Safe  

In `frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`:

Add a card fetching `GET /api/v1/investors/{id}/decision` that shows:

- Readiness badge: `Ready` (green) / `Ready with limits` (amber) / `Not ready` (red) / `Education only` (blue)
- Recommended investable capital %
- Required actions list (if any)
- Blocked actions list (if any)
- Warning messages

Empty state: if financial profile is missing, prompt to complete it.

**Implemented:** `ReadinessCard` component added to `dashboard/page.tsx`; fetches decision endpoint in parallel with dashboard data; shows badge+icon, explanation, warnings, required actions, blocked actions.

---

### TASK 6 — Update investor profile creation/edit with new fields

**Type:** Frontend  
**Risk:** 🟢 Safe (depends on TASK 1)  

After TASK 1 lands:

Update the login creation form and `/profile` edit page to include:
- `investment_goal` (select)
- `risk_tolerance` (select)
- `time_horizon` (select)
- `preferred_assets` (multi-select or checkboxes)
- `trading_frequency` (select)

These fields are nullable — existing profiles work without them. The decision engine uses them if present, falls back to defaults if absent.

---

### TASK 7 — Add tests for financial_decision engine ✅ DONE

**Type:** Tests  
**Risk:** 🟢 Safe  

Add `backend/tests/test_financial_decision.py`:

Required test cases:
1. Investor with no financial profile → `can_invest = False`
2. Investor with stability < 30 → `can_invest = False`, `required_actions` includes fund/debt action
3. Minor investor → `readiness_classification = "education_only"`
4. Stable investor with good metrics → `can_invest = True`, `readiness_classification = "ready"`
5. Moderate stability with high debt → `readiness_classification = "ready_with_limits"`
6. Investor with goal = education → `readiness_classification = "education_only"`

**Implemented:** `backend/tests/test_financial_decision.py` — 14 tests, all passing. Uses `SimpleNamespace` mocks; no DB required.

---

## 5. Task Order and Dependencies

```
TASK 0 (routing fix)   → unblocks all API testing
TASK 1 (schema)        → unblocks TASK 4 (partial) and TASK 6
TASK 2 (age rules)     → unblocks TASK 3
TASK 3 (risk fields)   → unblocks TASK 4 (full)
TASK 4 (decision engine) → unblocks TASK 5 and TASK 7
TASK 5 (dashboard card) → depends on TASK 4
TASK 6 (profile fields UI) → depends on TASK 1
TASK 7 (tests)         → depends on TASK 4
```

Recommended execution order: **~~0~~(done) → ~~1~~(done) → ~~2~~(done) → ~~3~~(done) → ~~4~~(done) → ~~7~~(done) → ~~5~~(done) → 6(next)**

---

## 6. Out of Scope for This Phase

The following are documented but explicitly deferred:

- Live trading execution engine
- Exchange connectors / broker API
- Real market data / candle import
- Multi-currency normalization engine
- Strategy parameter schema enforcement
- Backtest pass/fail lifecycle status
- Investor profile multi-step wizard redesign
- Family financial aggregation across members
- Workers / background job processing
- Kubernetes / production deployment

These belong to a future phase after Decision Engine Hardening is complete and validated.

---
