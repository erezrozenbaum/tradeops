# Changelog

All notable changes to TradeOps AI are documented here.  
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).  
Versions are assigned retroactively to match the git commit history.

---

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- CI workflow now automatically creates a GitHub release when all jobs pass and the version in `CHANGELOG.md` has not been released yet
- Docker images are now tagged with the explicit version number in addition to `latest` and `sha-*`
- Release creation is idempotent — pushing to `main` without bumping the version number does not create a duplicate release

---

## [0.8.0] — 2026-04-25

### Added
- Investor profile creation form on the login page — first-time users no longer need Swagger UI
- Investor creation auto-selects the new profile and redirects to the dashboard
- Empty-state on login page now opens the creation form automatically

### Fixed
- `docker-compose.yml` backend service now runs `alembic upgrade head` before starting uvicorn, so the DB schema is always in sync on first boot
- `docker-compose.yml` frontend service now uses a plain `node:20-alpine` image with `npm run dev`, eliminating the conflict between production Dockerfile and source-code volume mounts

### Documentation
- Created `CHANGELOG.md` (this file)
- Rewrote `README.md` with full setup and usage instructions
- Rewrote `docs/architecture.md` with current stack, module map, and API surface
- Created `docs/admin-guide.md` covering installation, configuration, and operations

### Added
- **Risk page** (`/risk`) — view and generate the investor risk model; shows stability score, classification, capital breakdown, allocation tiers, and full history

- **Backtesting page** (`/backtesting`) — run form with template, period, and optional seed; sidebar list of past runs; detail panel with 6 metrics + portfolio value chart
- **Paper trading page** (`/paper-trading`) — create portfolios from strategy templates; advance-tick simulation; close portfolio; portfolio value chart over ticks
- **AI Reports page** (`/reports`) — generate a full AI financial report with 7 sections: summary, financial health, risk profile, strategy analysis, backtest insights, paper trading performance, recommendations
- **Audit log page** (`/audit`) — paginated list of all audit events with collapsible metadata; load-more button

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-25

### Added
- Next.js 14 frontend application with App Router and `(auth)` / `(dashboard)` route groups
- Login page with investor profile selector stored in `localStorage`
- Dashboard shell with sidebar navigation
- `useInvestorId` hook — reads `tradeops_investor_id` from localStorage, redirects to `/login` if absent
- UI component library: `Card`, `Badge`, `Button`, `Input`, `Select` using Tailwind + class-variance-authority
- `formatCurrency` and `formatPercent` utility functions
- Recharts integration for line charts (backtesting and paper trading)
- `public/.gitkeep` to ensure Docker `COPY --from=builder /app/public` succeeds in CI

### Fixed

- Frontend `next.config.js` simplified to fix Docker standalone build issues

### Commits
- `b3ef97a` Add frontend UI shell and fix CI Docker build failures
